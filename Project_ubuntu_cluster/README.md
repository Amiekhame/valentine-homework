
### Block 1: Check for Vagrant Installation

This block checks if the "vagrant" command is available in the system's PATH. If Vagrant is not found, it displays a message to prompt the user to install it.

### Block 2: Create a Vagrantfile

This block creates a Vagrantfile with Ruby configuration for multiple virtual machines. It defines three nodes: "Master," "Slave," and "LoadBalancer," specifying their configurations, IP addresses, and provisioning scripts.

### Block 3: Master Node Configuration

- Configures the "Master" node with the "ubuntu/bionic64" box, assigns a private IP address (192.168.33.10), and sets memory and CPU resources.
- Defines provisioning for the "Master" node, which includes updating packages, installing the LAMP stack, configuring MySQL root password, setting up Apache, creating a PHP test file, adding a user ("altschool") with sudo privileges, generating an SSH key pair, creating a directory with files, and displaying running processes.

### Block 4: Slave Node Configuration

- Configures the "Slave" node with similar settings as the "Master" node but with a different IP address (192.168.33.11).
- Defines provisioning for the "Slave" node, which also includes updating packages, installing the LAMP stack, configuring MySQL, setting up Apache, and creating a PHP test file.

### Block 5: Load Balancer Node Configuration

- Configures the "LoadBalancer" node with an IP address (192.168.33.12) and specifies memory and CPU resources.
- Defines provisioning for the "LoadBalancer" node, which installs and configures Nginx as a simple load balancer. It forwards traffic to the "Master" and "Slave" nodes.

### Block 6: Vagrant Up and Deployment

This block initiates the deployment of the virtual machines by running `vagrant up` after defining the entire Vagrant configuration.

### Block 7: Completion Message

Displays a completion message indicating that the deployment is finished. It also provides URLs to access the "Master" and "Slave" nodes' PHP test pages.

This script essentially automates the setup of a multi-node environment with the LAMP stack, user management, SSH key generation, and load balancing using Nginx. It's designed to create a development or testing environment for web applications and services.
